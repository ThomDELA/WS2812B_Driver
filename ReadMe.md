This is a small driver for WS2812b smart RGB leds with an example. It mostly uses AVR assembly to get the right timing, which is the critical part with thoose leds.

Use atmel studio to open project. I use avrdude from adruino toolkit to upload into micro.

You should only reuse ledMatrix.* sources.
